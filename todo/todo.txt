1. Need to make it so that the rbtOrBcba only appears once. There is no need for this to be updated (except in special cases).

2. There should be a check to make sure that the user has populated all necessary information before the sign up is complete.

3. Make it so that there is a data table base uniquely associated to a program.

4. Make it so that the user can input details for a program.

5. Add a hold to goals in a behavioral_plan (this is so that the goals can be put on hold... that might not be clear to me later on)


6. Modify behaviorPlans.ejs so that it has a post request
