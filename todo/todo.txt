1. Need to make it so that the rbtOrBcba only appears once. There is no need for this to be updated (except in special cases).

2. There should be a check to make sure that the user has populated all necessary information before the sign up is complete.

3. Make it so that there is a data table base uniquely associated to a program.

4. Make it so that the user can input details for a program.

5. Add a hold to goals in a behavioral_plan (this is so that the goals can be put on hold... that might not be clear to me later on)


6. Modify behaviorPlans.ejs so that it has a post request

7. Somehow make it so that the goal_type in the goal table is consistent with an item from the corresponding goal_type table entry





Current Idea for the behavior plan:

New Behavior Plan Page, actually this should be the same as the edit behavior plan, but there just shouldn't be any goals yet.

Edit behavior plan (this should be on the behaviorPlan.ejs). This should have the title of the behavior plan on top, then the 
    description of the behavior plan. It should also have the name of the client on top so that you know you are on the correct
    page. Then it should list all of the associated goals titles as you scroll down. You can click on a goal to go to its relevant
    page (which should be given by goal.ejs). If you want to add a goal (this can only be done if you do not already have 30 goals),
    then you can click on add new goal. Adding a new goal will first add a new goal to the goal database and then modify the 
    behaviorPlan entry with the correct goal. The page associated with this goal will then be retrieved (goal.ejs).
